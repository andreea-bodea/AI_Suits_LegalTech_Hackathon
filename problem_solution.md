# HACKATHON MUNICH 2025

Team: AI Suits
Challenge: LEGORA


## Problem statement:

Legal professionals are often overloaded with documents to review and many of these documents require a particular attention to a detailed regulation and a sequential legal analysis. Particularly in the case of rental contract is important to take into consideration not only the legal framework applicable but also the court decisions on the matter to draft an appropriate contract. All this requires time and efforts, which give raise to the question on how we can use AI tools to support legal professionals in these complex tasks while we ensure reliability, precision and trust.


## Solution:

We designed an AI application to review rental contracts. The app fetches an uploaded contract against the legal provisions applicable and relevant case law. It then classifies the contract depending of applicable law and make suggestions of changes, whether to rephrase, remove or add elements or clauses. The user can refuse or accept amendments. For the accepted amendments, the app can generate an updated version of the contract and with it a report for the lawyer, with the references of the changes made citing the law applicable and relevant case law. In addition, the app is capable of providing a second report aimed for the client, explaining the different parts of the contract in more simple language.
